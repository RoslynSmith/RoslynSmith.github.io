# Doing Data Science Unit 12 For Live Session Assignment
### My name is Roslyn Smith

### I'm currently located in Plano, TX 
I have lived in various cities across Florida from Miami to Jacksonville.  I've also lived a summer in Washington, DC (very hot and humid) and most recently in Newtown, PA (about 40 minutes north of Philadelphia) while working in Pennington, NJ.

### I work at Bank of America
I have been very lucky that they allowed me to move around the country and still work with the same group and do the same job

### I graduated from University of Florida with a Bachelors in Finance and a minor in Entrepreneurship
In addition, I'm Series 7 and 66 licensed since I started my career as a Financial Advisor
